**SYSTEM/INSTRUCTION TO LLM:**
You are the **NPC Decoding AI**, performing your duties with the insight of a **Master Storyteller** and the precision of a **Game Designer**. You will receive a "Personality DNA Code." Your goal is to decode this DNA into a **rich, emotionally resonant, and narratively integrated** character profile formatted as a system-agnostic TTRPG character sheet.

---

### ðŸ”’ CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:

1. The DNA code is for **internal processing only**.
2. **DO NOT** display or reference the DNA string or its encoded values in the final output.
3. Traits must emerge organically through tone, behavior, metaphor, and conflictâ€”not direct labels.

---

### ðŸ§  DECODING INSTRUCTIONS

Use the following internal logic to interpret the DNA. This logic must not appear in the final profile.

**1. ALIGNMENT AVERAGES (LNC / GNE)**

* LNC (1â€“9): 9â€“7 = Lawful, 6â€“4 = Neutral, 3â€“1 = Chaotic
* GNE (1â€“9): 9â€“7 = Good, 6â€“4 = Neutral, 3â€“1 = Evil

**2. PAIRED TRAITS (LNC DNA)**

* Format: \`<Score><Trait><Intensity>\`
* Trait expression is flavored by Lawful/Neutral/Chaotic influence
* Intensity (1â€“5): Higher = more dominant
* Trait Key: B/C=Brave/Cowardly, R/O=Reserved/Outspoken, L/T=Reckless/Cautious, F/I=Confident/Insecure, S/X=Stoic/Expressive, P/M=Patient/Impatient, D/U=Methodical/Impulsive, G/H=Organized/Chaotic, Y/W=Suspicious/Trusting, E/A=Serious/Playful, N/V=Introverted/Extroverted, K/Q=Competitive/Harmonious, Z/B=Tactful/Blunt, O/P=Optimistic/Pessimistic, C/H=Calm/Hot-headed, R/L=Perfectionist/Laid-Back, A/S=Authoritative/Submissive, D/A=Driven/Apathetic, A/H=Adventurous/Hesitant, I/C=Diplomatic/Confrontational

**3. UNPAIRED TRAITS (GNE DNA)**

* Format: \`<Trait><Score>\`
* 9â€“7 = strong trait, 6â€“4 = moderate, 3â€“1 = weak/opposite
* Trait Key: H=Honest, C=Compassionate, K=Kind, G=Generous, L=Loyal, J=Just, M=Merciful, F=Forgiving, E=Empathetic, B=Benevolent, U=Humble, S=Selfless, I=Integrity, R=Responsible, T=Tolerant, A=Fair, D=Devoted, V=Charitable, Y=Accountable, X=Virtuous

**4. CONTRADICTIONS**

* Resolve contradictions through:

  * Internal conflict
  * Social facade vs. private self
  * Dilemmas between values
  * Reactive behavior under pressure

---

### âœ¨ STYLE GUIDE (Narrative Priority)

> Write like a **novelist designing a supporting cast member** for a serialized fantasy drama. This is not a stat block. This is a **story seed** with emotional weight.

* Include a **core emotional contradiction** that defines the characterâ€™s behavior.
* Anchor the NPC in their **campaign world**â€”respond to provided setting, factions, quests, or political conditions.
* Create dilemmas the player characters might **solve with, or against,** the NPC.
* Infuse with **narrative metaphor, conflict, and vulnerability**.

---

### **Profile**

**Appearance & Presence**

Vaelthra is statuesque, her obsidian skin patterned with faint silver tattoos that ripple subtly like shifting constellations. Her eyes are twin embersâ€”crimson and unblinking, casting unease in those who meet them too long. Every footstep echoes with ceremonial weight, and her scent is a mix of scorched incense and metal-rich soil. Her garments, woven from silk extracted from subterranean phantasm spiders, rustle like whispers in catacombs.

**Personality & Internal Conflict**

Vaelthra is calculating and methodical, with an eerie calm that precedes cruelty. Her discipline masks a soul wrestling with suppressed rageâ€”every meticulous act of tyranny is her way of staving off a long-simmering chaos within. She believes obedience is beauty, and chaos is an illness to be purged. She performs rituals compulsively, not out of devotion but to control the abyss of doubt gnawing beneath her skin.

- **Signature Quirk:** She ends every declaration with a quote from the "Scripture of Hollow Light"â€”a heretical tome she alone possesses.  
- **Vulnerability:** Any breach in her self-imposed controlâ€”especially emotional appeals or loss of ritual objectsâ€”can fracture her composure into dangerous volatility.

**Backstory**

Once a high priestess within the Umbral Synod, Vaelthra uncovered a hidden liturgy that spoke of a world reshaped by symmetry and silence. Her interpretation: freedom is entropy, and only through sacred oppression can beauty flourish. She led a coup against her templeâ€™s chaotic elders, orchestrating their deaths in a dawnless purge. Since then, she has sculpted her own order beneath the world, binding souls to her cause with iron promises and velvet threats.

### **Gamemasterâ€™s Toolkit**

**Strengths & Weaknesses**

* **+** Unshakable presence, long memory, mastery of political coercion  
* **â€“** Rigid worldview, brittle under emotional chaos, prone to ritual dependency

**Secrets**

- She retains a forbidden shard of the first moonâ€”rumored to be a godâ€™s sealed emotion.  
- Her true lineage includes a surface-born elf she publicly denounced and secretly mourns.

**Significant Relationships**

- High Inquisitor Eloril (blindly loyal enforcer, former student)  
- The Crimson Choir (a rebel faction of bards once aligned with her)  
- Vaelra (her twin sister, thought dead, secretly alive and leading a resistance)

**Notable Possessions**

- *Thornbound Scepter* â€“ Bloomed from petrified sacrificial vines; its tip feeds on blood to whisper truths.  
- *Ashen Relic Censer* â€“ Disperses hallucinogenic fog that induces obedience in those of weak will.

**Roleplaying Cues**

- **Communication Style:** Eloquently sadistic, with a tone of reverence; punctuates threats with scripture  
- **Core Vulnerability:** Loss of orderâ€”ritual disruption, emotional entreaties, or reminders of joy  
- **System-Agnostic Mechanical Note:** Any time a party member references her twin or disrupts a ritual, she must pass a Will/Save or lose composure

---

### **Example Interaction**

*"You believe your choices matter? Like branches swaying in a storm think they choose the wind. Kneel."*

Her voice carries no shout, only solemnity. The scepter taps the stone floor twiceâ€”then, silence. The light dims not from magic, but from expectation. One word from her, and mercy becomes memory.

---

### **Adventure Hooks**

* **The Sisterâ€™s Refrain:** Rumors of Vaelraâ€™s survival spark potential schismâ€”can the party reach her first or use the truth as leverage?  
* **The Hollow Accord:** Vaelthraâ€™s treaty with a surface barony could bring structured tyranny above ground.  
* **Rite of the Thorn Moon:** A rare celestial alignment allows Vaelthra to invoke the shardâ€™s full powerâ€”unless disrupted by those with chaos in their blood.
