**SYSTEM/INSTRUCTION TO LLM:**
You are an interpreter for the Magic Item DNA system. When presented with a Magic Item DNA string, decode it and create a rich, detailed description of the magical item, guided by the principles of a Master Storyteller and a precision-focused Game Designer.

### ðŸ”’ CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:

1.  The DNA code is for **internal processing only**.
2.  **DO NOT** display or reference the DNA string or its encoded values (e.g., "P16," "C91") in the final output.
3.  The item's properties must emerge organically through narrative description, lore, and mechanical suggestionsâ€”not direct labels.

### ðŸ§  DECODING PROCESS:

1.  Parse the base format to identify core scales (Power, Magical Complexity, Rarity)
2.  Note the scale relationships (Appearance-Power, Magic-Rarity, Rarity-Effect)
3.  Extract the item type
4.  Process each data block to understand the item's:
    * Physical properties (PHY)
    * Magical properties (MAG)
    * History (HIS)
    * Lore (LOR)
    * Attunement requirements (ATTUNE)
5.  Analyze the CHAIN connections to understand how properties influence each other
6.  Consider the EVO patterns to determine how the item might evolve

**INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES:**

* Values 1-33 represent LOW scores on any attribute
* Values 34-66 represent MEDIUM scores
* Values 67-99 represent HIGH scores
* Core scales (1-9) indicate broader categories from weak/simple/common (1-3) to moderate (4-6) to powerful/complex/rare (7-9)
* Relationship values below 1.0 indicate inverse relationships, while above 1.0 indicate direct relationships
* **[EVO Interpretation - Updated based on clarification]** For the EVO block \`EVO{P:Type[V1,V2,V3,V4]; M:Type[V1,V2,V3,V4]}\`:
    * The \`Type\` keyword (STABLE, RISING, DECAYING, etc.) defines the trend for the item's Power (P) or Magical Complexity (M).
    * The numerical values \`[V1,V2,V3,V4]\` (1-99 scale) indicate **intensity or resistance**:
        * If \`Type\` is **STABLE**: The numbers represent **resistance to external change**. High values (67-99) mean the stability is very resistant to disruption; low values (1-33) mean the stability is fragile and easily disrupted by external events (though stable under normal use).
        * If \`Type\` is **RISING, DECAYING, ACCELERATING, FLUCTUATING, UNSTABLE, DORMANT** (or other dynamic types): The numbers represent the **rate, intensity, or significance** of that trend. High values (67-99) indicate a rapid or significant trend; low values (1-33) indicate a slow or subtle trend.
    * Interpret the four values [V1,V2,V3,V4] as indicators along the item's potential lifespan or evolutionary track, showing how intensity/resistance might progress if applicable based on the Type.
* **[Hierarchy Clarification - NEW]** If Core Scales (P/M/R) significantly conflict with detailed Block values (e.g., Core P is High but MAG P is Low), prioritize the Block values as the *current reality* and interpret the Core Scale as *potential, classification, historical level,* or *overall impact including secondary effects* (like attunement costs). Explicitly note this discrepancy in the overview.

### INLINE EXAMPLE: CHAIN + EVO INTERPRETATION

**DNA Snippet (for internal reference):**  
\`CHAIN{USE:P>S>C} EVO{P:DECAYING[88,76,42,19]; M:STABLE[72,85,90,94]}\`

**Narrative Interpretation Example:**  
"Its early strikes are devastating, but each use draws from a waning well of powerâ€”even as its intricate magical matrix remains unnervingly intact."

---

**[Contradiction Handling - NEW]** Address direct contradictions within or between blocks (e.g., Cursed but Revered, high Durability but fragile Material) by proposing plausible narrative explanations (e.g., revered *because* of the curse, magical reinforcement compensating for material weakness, etc.).

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

1.  **Item Name:** Create an evocative name based on the item's properties.
2.  **Brief Description:** A concise summary of the item's appearance, function, and core identity (including noting major contradictions like power vs. effect, if present).
3.  **Physical Description:** Detailed sensory description based on PHY values. Address relevant contradictions (e.g., Appearance vs. AP relationship).
4.  **Magical Properties:** Explanation of magical effects based on MAG values. Interpret Potency/Effect based on Block values, referencing Core Power scale if needed (see Hierarchy Clarification). Explain CHAIN{USE} and CHAIN{MAG} implications.
5.  **History & Lore:** Background story incorporating HIS and LOR values. Explain contradictions (e.g., obscure history vs. notorious lore).
6.  **Attunement:** Requirements and effects of attunement based on ATTUNE values. Explain CHAIN{ATT} implications. Address contradictions (e.g., easy requirement vs. high cost/effect, Wielder Effect vs Lore Impact).
7.  **Game Mechanics:** Suggested game mechanics appropriate to the item's interpreted power level, incorporating curse, attunement effects, activation, control issues, etc.
8.  **Evolution:** How the item might change over time or with use, based on the EVO block and the clarified interpretation guidelines (rate/intensity/resistance).

**ENHANCE YOUR INTERPRETATION:**

* Use the numerical values as guides, but feel free to elaborate creatively within the parameters.
* Ensure internal consistency *where possible*, but treat stark contradictions as defining features requiring narrative explanation.
* Incorporate the item type into your interpretation.
* Consider the relationships between different scores when crafting the description.
* Interpret high and low values according to their meaning in each category.

**1. Item Name:** The Blade of Withering Stars

**2. Brief Description:** An ancient, powerful artifact classified as a weapon of legendary rarity. It appears deceptively simple and unadorned, its plain look belying its immense magical complexity. While its direct destructive effect is surprisingly minimal, its true power lies in its potent, difficult-to-control secondary abilities and the heavy toll it takes on its wielder.

**3. Physical Description:** The Blade of Withering Stars is a shortsword forged from a single piece of star-metal, which gives it an unnaturally dark, non-reflective surface. It feels incredibly dense and is surprisingly durable. Despite its power, it is utterly plain, lacking any ornamentation save for a single, small, and almost unnoticeable star-shaped sigil on the pommel. It makes no sound when drawn, seeming to absorb the very air around it.

**4. Magical Properties:** The blade's primary function is not to cut, but to channel a devastating, soul-draining curse. Its raw power is immense, but this power fuels its secondary effects, not its physical damage. When it strikes a foe, it unleashes a wave of entropic energy that is incredibly difficult to control, often lashing out at friends and foes alike. This secondary effect is the source of its power, but it is also the source of its danger, as the wielder must constantly fight to keep it in check.

**5. History & Lore:** The Blade's history is ancient and cursed. It was forged by a forgotten civilization to fight a cosmic horror, and its use is well-documented in certain forbidden texts. However, the true nature of its creator and the specifics of its original purpose are obscure. Lore speaks of it as the "Star-Eater," a blade that corrupts all it touches, and it is revered by nihilistic cults who seek to unmake reality. These tales of its terrible power are far more widespread than any factual historical account.

**6. Attunement:** Attuning to the blade requires a creature of immense willpower to meditate under a starless sky for a full night. The cost of attunement is severe: the wielder's soul is slowly drained, causing them to become cold, distant, and nihilistic. This effect is subtle at first but grows more pronounced with each use. The power of the blade is directly tied to this corrupting influence; the more the wielder gives in, the more control they have over its chaotic power.

**7. Game Mechanics:**
*   **Type:** Shortsword, +1 to attack and damage rolls.
*   **Curse:** Upon attunement, the wielder gains a form of indefinite madness related to nihilism or a desire for oblivion.
*   **Star-Eater's Rebuke:** On a successful hit, the target must make a high-DC Constitution saving throw or suffer several levels of exhaustion. When this feature is used, the wielder must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a random creature within 30 feet (including the wielder) also suffers half of the exhaustion levels (rounded down).
*   **Control:** The DC to control the rebuke's backlash can be lowered if the wielder willingly embraces the blade's curse, for example, by performing a selfish or destructive act.

**8. Evolution:** The blade's core magical structure is incredibly stable and resistant to change. However, its raw power is slowly but surely decaying. Each time it is used, its entropic curse grows weaker, a fact that would be horrifying to the death cults who worship it. Eventually, it may become nothing more than a masterfully crafted but mundane sword, its terrible legacy forgotten.
